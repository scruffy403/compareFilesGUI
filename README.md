# Python Scripts for File Comparisons

This repo has two different script for comparing files. 

## identify_differences.py 
This will take two files and produces two outputs. The first is a file that the user can choose a name for in the GUI, for example `output_file.csv`
This file will show differences between the files within the cells of the output file so the user can locate differences in the original files if needed.   
A second file will be produced that provides summary data of the differences. The file name of this will prepend `summary` to the user selected file name, ie., `summary_output_file.csv`  
See below for more details about usage. Some information is also available when you are using hte GUI.
